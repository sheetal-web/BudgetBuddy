# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://budget-buddy-drab.vercel.app/).

I’ve built a mini project using React.js with Context API and Hooks. This allows users to keep track of their income and expenses in real-time.

🛠️ Key Features:
- Add and manage unlimited income and expense entries 💰
- Instantly see the effect on your overall balance 💼
- Sleek and user-friendly interface 🎨
